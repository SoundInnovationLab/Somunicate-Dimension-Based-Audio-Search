# Somunicate-Dimension-Based-Audio-Search
This program uses data collected and organized by the Somunicate Research Team to find the sound exhibiting qualities nearest to those input by the user. 
Once run through Streamlit, the program allows users to pick up to 19 audio dimensions. Once chosen, the user can choose the extent to which their desired sound matches the specified dimensions on a sliding scale (-1 being opposite, 0 being neutral, and 1 being the epitome of the quality). 
The program leverages the dynamic capabilities of Streamlit, allowing the user to alter dimensions and scalings at any point in order to recieve a different sound.
To launch the program, run "python -m streamlit run SomunicateDBAS" in terminal.
